# FootyPredictions

# About
This project is a method to predict the final outcome of a football (soccer) game using historical data and halftime data. The techinques used are a Feedforward NN and a SGDClassifier. The data was collected using the code in this project from a variety of free resources. If you want to replicate this project for your own purposes, check out the Final Version (there is a script there to help you automatically set you on this way).

# Final Version  
For the final version of this project, as well as a more detailed README and a paper describing the work, click on "Capstone\Submissions"
The final version contains a method to generate all the files you see here in the main directory. They are all important to scrape the data required data.

# Note  
The neural network created in this project is formatted in a jupyter notebook for easier viewing.
